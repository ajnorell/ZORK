/**
 * Class Game - the main class of the "Zork" game.

 * 
 *  This class is the main class of the "Zork" application. Zork is a very
 *  simple, text based adventure game.  Users can walk around some scenery.
 *  That's all. It should really be extended to make it more interesting!
 * 
 *  To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 *  routine.
 * 
 *  This main class creates and initializes all the others: it creates all
 *  rooms, creates the parser and starts the game.  It also evaluates the
 *  commands that the parser returns.
